Hi! I've recently finishing my masters in AI/ML at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://mff.cuni.cz) of [Charles University](https://cuni.cz) in Prague. In addition to all things machine learning I'm also interested in computer languages and generally software engineering/computer science as a whole. When not playing with computer-related stuff I like to do curling, hike, swim, enjoy theatre, read, and [argue with strangers on the internet](https://xkcd.com/386/).

This blog contains mainly notes I've written primarily for myself but then considered potentially useful enough to share. Sharing is caring after all, and I care for all of you <3. Therefore the posts might sometimes be slightly incomprehensible and/or flat out wrong.  

You can find more information about me at [petrroll.cz](https://petrroll.cz) or [github.com/petrroll](https://github.com/petrroll).
