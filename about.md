Hi! I'm currently finishing my masters in AI/ML at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://mff.cuni.cz) of [Charles University](https://cuni.cz) in Prague. In addition to all things machine learning I'm also interested in computer languages and generally software engineering/computer science as a whole. 

When not playing with computer related stuff I like to do curling, hike, cycle, read, and [argue with strangers on the internet](https://xkcd.com/386/).

You can find more information about me at [petrroll.cz](https://petrroll.cz)
